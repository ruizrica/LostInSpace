## Lost in Space - Section 5: Algorithmic Enhancements

---

#### Time: 30 Minutes

#### Storyline:
With your communication system back online, a myriad of data starts streaming in from Earth. Manually processing this flood of information proves time-consuming and error-prone. The realization dawns that leveraging the power of algorithms could expedite and optimize this task, ensuring a safer journey home.

#### Objectives:
1. Understand the benefits of algorithms.
2. Implement a basic data processing algorithm.
3. Compare manual and algorithmic data processing techniques.

#### Challenge 1: The Power of Algorithms

Reflect on why algorithms are essential:

- They offer a clear set of instructions to solve problems.
- They significantly enhance processing speeds.
- They guarantee consistency and accuracy in repetitive tasks.

#### Challenge 2: Implement a Data Processing Algorithm

Your ship receives temperature data from Earth to fine-tune its thermal system. The data arrives as a list of numbers. Your task: create an algorithm that computes the average temperature.

```javascript
function calculateAverageTemperature(temperatureData) {
  // Your code here
}
```

#### Challenge 3: Manual vs. Algorithmic Processing

To appreciate the algorithm's efficiency, manually determine the average of a small dataset first. Then employ your algorithm to achieve the same.

```javascript
const smallDataSet = [25, 27, 24, 26, 29, 23];
// Manually calculate the average

const algorithmicAverage = calculateAverageTemperature(smallDataSet);
console.log("Algorithmic Average: ", algorithmicAverage);
```
